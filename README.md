# UofSC-Walking-Bridges
Two walking bridges behind 300 Main St. at the UofSC used for testing and validating structural health monitoring solutions. The Northern bridge (A) and southern bridge (B) span Rocky Branch Creek and constructed of recycled railroad tracks and reinforced concrete cast in place.
